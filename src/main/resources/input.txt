There's a songbird who sings:
"Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven."
It makes me wonder
It makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking.
